A Quickbooks-inspired Django based ERP that is completely open source. This app will be a [12Factor](http://12factor.net/) app that will be easily deployable to public clouds such as [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) by using PaaS's such as [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and [Deis](http://deis.io).
